Abstract:
  This repository is assembled to contain all materials and code documenting my Final Project in DATA 512 in the MSDS program
  at the University of Washington. The high-level goal of this assigment was to find a publicly available and properly licensed
  data set and to pursue a research question into it. My high-level goal was to investigate paid parking in Seattle in order to 
  make recommendations regarding the easiest way to park as an individual in the city.  More information and process 
  can be found in the included Jupyter Notebook Final Project Report.ipynb. 

Included Files:

  Final Project Report.ipynb is a Juypter notebook that includes all writing and code needed to follow (and reproduce) my
  Final Project analysis. 

  parking_sampled_init.csv.zip is a zipped data file that contains all parking transactions used in the analysis.
  It should be unzipped before running the code in the Results section of the notebook. A more detailed description
  of the data and its attributes can be found below.
  
  Ballard.png, GreenLake.png, and UptownTriangle.png are image files that feature screenshots taken from Google Maps
  of the emptiest blocks in each named parking area. These files are embedded in the Jupyter Notebook.
  
  Seattle Hourly.png, Commercial Core Hourly.png, Capitol Hill Hourly.png, and Ballard Locks Hourly.png are image files
  of figures produced in the Jupyter notebook for occupancy calculated by hour of day and day of week in various
  parking areas. 

  LICENSE is a MIT license for all code contained in the Jupyter Notebook. 

Data Attributes (parking_sampled_init.csv):

OccupancyDateTime: Time parking transaction took place
PaidOccupancy: Number of paid transactions on the blockface live at the time
BlockfaceName: Street block being parked on
SideOfStreet: Cardinal direction indicating which side of the block being parked on
SourceElementKey: Unique ID for city street segment
ParkingTimeLimitCategory: Time limit of parking in minutes
ParkingSpaceCount: How many parking spaces the blockface holds
PaidParkingArea: Defined parking area the block is in, effectively the neighborhood
PaidParkingSubArea: Sub parking area the block is in, effectively subneighborhood
PaidParkingRate: Deprecated
ParkingCategory: Paid or Restricted Parking Zone
Location: Lat-long of parking location

The included dataset is in the public domain as published by the Seattle Department of Transportation.
