Bias in Data
Name: Zachary Garcia
Date: 10/16/19

Goal
The goal of this project is to explore the concept of bias through data on Wikipedia articles about political figures from a variety of countries.

Data sources used
To create these tables, I drew data from three sources. First was a list of Wikipedia articles about politicians with countries for each specified pulled from Figshare. Citation: Keyes, Os (2017): Politicians by Country from the English-language Wikipedia. figshare. Dataset. Source URL: https://figshare.com/articles/Untitled_Item/5513449.

Second was population data for all countries of the world as well as population rolled up into world regions, drawn from the world population datasheet published by the Population Reference Bureau. Source URL: https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/population/table. I downloaded the actual file WPDS_2018_data.csv from DATA 512's Canvas files page though. 

Third was the Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES) API which uses ML to estimate the quality of Wikipedia articles.
